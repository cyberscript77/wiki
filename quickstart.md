- Copy or Extract the `bin` folder to your Cyberpunk 2077 game installed folder.

### Linux and Steam Deck

In order to install our mod in Linux or Steam Deck, follow this [guide](installation-linux.md)


## 3 - Playing with CyberScript
You can get any mods that using cyberscript by looking in *requirements* -> *mods requiring this
file*
section on the Nexus webpage.
CyberScript alone will do nothing since it's a framework !

Mods powered by Cyberscript can only work in cyberscript framework.

### First use : 
#### Define a type of controller (keyboard or gamepad)
  1-  Pause Menu <br/>
  2 - Go to "Mods"  <br/>
  3 - Go to "Cyberscript Setting"  <br/>
  4 - Check or not the toggle about controller : 
![alt controller](./assets/images/gettings-started/playing-with-cyberscript/controller.jpg)

?> For let you understand how it's work : <br/> Cyberscript got 2 kind of keybinding configuration : Keyboard or Controller. <br/> That's means for one keybind, you can have 2 kind of configuration. This toggle load one or the other one configuration.

You can check which configuration is loaded in each Cyberscript based mods settings : 
![alt controller-config](./assets/images/gettings-started/playing-with-cyberscript/controller-config.jpg)

#n# 4 - Enable a Mod that require Cyberscript

?> This method is for Cyberscript Core 4.0 and more

Install them throught Vortex or manually, like any other mods.

?> Sometimes Vortex will display this :  <br/> ![alt 5](./assets/images/gettings-started/vortex.jpg) <br/> It's because Audioware mods are not recognized by the CP2077 Vortex extension yet. <br/> In this case, click on Yes, Intall to Staging Anyway

You can find settings for each mods by doing :  <br/>
1-  Pause Menu <br/>
2 - Go to "Mods"  <br/>


## 5 -Cycle throught Interact

Since we can't display so much interact in same time, you need to select which one you want use from the mod that contains it.

Depending on if you play with a controller or keyboard, you need to keybind some key in order to switch between using keyboard or controller.

First one, Cycle Custom Intereact is very important, to bind it, open Mods setting and go to Cyberscript binding:

![alt 1](./assets/images/cet-key-binding/../gettings-started/cet-key-binding/pause.png)

![alt 1](./assets/images/cet-key-binding/../gettings-started/cet-key-binding/keybindtab.png)

![alt 1](./assets/images/cet-key-binding/../gettings-started/cet-key-binding/keybind.png)

Hotkeys Amount means how many hotkeys you need to hit for trigger the menu (aka combo)

Hold the key means that the key need to be holded

This key will allow you to go through current selected Mods's interacts if the Mods has any within it's folder.

![alt 2](./assets/images/cet-key-binding/../gettings-started/cet-key-binding/2.jpg)

Use the interact "Select active Interactions Group" to open the menu and select the current active Mods

![alt 3](./assets/images/cet-key-binding/../gettings-started/cet-key-binding/3.jpg)

then use Cycle Custom Interact key to choose the interact you want to use.
