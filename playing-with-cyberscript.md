> Should I say "How to use datapacks ?" Nvm..


When enabling any datapack, whether it be in bunches or one at a time, ALWAYS GO TO CyberScript settings to `REFRESH DATAPACK CACHE`.

# Enable an datapack


1- Go to Pause Menu <br/>
2 - Go to "Mods"  <br/>
3 - Go to "Cyberscript Datapack Manager" Tabs  <br/>
4 - Enable the datapack you need/want  <br/>
5 - Go to "Cyberscript settings" Tabs and hit REFRESH DATAPACK CACHE at the bottom.
Close Pause Menu

then follow this [CET Keybinding configuration](cet-key-binding.md)



?> If you have any problem in installation look into [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) or post it on Discord.
