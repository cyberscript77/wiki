If you want to download and setup everything on your computer and then transfer it to your deck, you can do that easily by installing Warpinator on the Steam Deck/Linux Machine and Winpinator (Windows version) on your Windows PC.

There are a few things that you are going to need to before we get started; these are Protontricks, the .Net Runtimes, the latest version of CET, the latest version of Native Setting Mod, ProtonUp-QT, and the latest version of CyberScript itself.

(The links will be below for the .Net Runtimes, the latest version of CET, the latest version of Native Setting Mod, and the latest version of CyberScript. Protontricks and ProtonUp-QT you can find in the Discover Software Center)

CyberScript - https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/6475?tab=files (download the latest version)

Native Settings UI - https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/3518?tab=files (download the latest version)

Cyber Engine Tweaks - https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/107?tab=files (download the latest version)

.Net 3.1.21 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-3.1.21-windows-x64-installer

.Net 5.0.12 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.12-windows-x64-installer

.Net 6.0.8 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-6.0.8-windows-x64-installer

!> ‚ÄúCurrently, this is a stock KDE Plasma experience in terms of installing software. You can use the Discover Software Center (on the taskbar) to install apps. The Discover Software Center installs applications using flatpak technology (more on this below) onto the writeable portion of your drive. If you know your way around a Linux command line you can directly use flatpak commands to install applications. Common browsers, music players, and other kinds of applications are already available via these methods, and we expect that many more will be updated, fixed, and available after launch.‚Äù
IF YOU ARE USING THE GOG VERSION OF CYBERPUNK 2077 ADD THE GAME TO STEAM IN DESKTOP MODE BY CLICKING ADD A GAME AND THEN SELECTING ADD A NON-STEAM GAME.

# Installation

1. The first thing you are going to want to do is install Protontricks. If you are on steam deck, you will find it in the Discover Software Center.
2. You are going to want to install CET if you haven‚Äôt already. For Steam Deck, you can find the wiki link to install it here: https://wiki.redmodding.org/cyber-engine-tweaks/getting-started/installing/untitled
3. Unzip the Native Settings UI file that you downloaded. This will give you a bin file. You are going to want to drag this bin folder into your Cyberpunk install directory. Example: local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077 (If it asks you to override anything say skip to all).
4. Unzip the CyberScript file that you downloaded, this will give you a bin file. You are going to want to drag this bin folder into your Cyberpunk install directory. Example: local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077 (main directory pathway)
